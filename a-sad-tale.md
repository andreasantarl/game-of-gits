House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark was invited to King's Landing to meet privately with King Joffrey to
discuss issues of the realm.  Joffrey and Ned were eating some delicious chicken
wings, and Joffrey choked on a chicken bone.  He immediately died. Surprisingly,
Queen Cersei also choked on a chicken bone, and she died too, along with the
rest of their family.  Because of inbreeding, they had severe genetic problems
with swallowing their food.  Too bad.  Given how much everyone loved the Starks,
Ned was immediately offered the crown and became the new Protector of the Realm.
